- `1307.4812_macedo2013_xact.nb`: Boson Stars are equilibrium self-gravitating solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory. We obtain the background field equations by varying the action, then with a particular ansatz, we compute the explicit form of the equations of motion that can be numerically solved to obtain the boson star metric. We derive Eqns. 3 and 6-11 of  https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4812
